# Pong-remake
We all know the classic Pong game in the old days <br> 
So in this project, me and my friend decided to do something different: Download a bunch of cool pokemon pics to remake the graphics!!! <b> And also add some new elements of our own </b>. <br>
For more details, please check this tutorial to find out what did we change in the gameplay:<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ic3u6p2qf9wgakc/Tutorial.docx?dl=0"> Pong remake introduction </a>
<br> <br>
In this project, we use <b> Java Swing </b> to draw the images. <br>
Here is a gameplay screenshot! Enjoy!!!
